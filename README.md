This is my first project, a simple python terminal calculator that can add, divide, subtract and multiply. 
# Instructions

Run the file in terminal

It will welcome you with a message saying 'Welcome to the super simple terminal calculator!'


It will prompt you then with `Please enter a number` inwhich you input a number that you would like to perform a calculation on. This will not work with anything other than numbers.


After a number is inputted it will display `Choose an operator (*)(/)(+)(-)` You will input one of the operators *, /, +, - which are in order multiply, divide, addition, subtraction.


Once a valid input is given it will then display `Choose the second number` Just alike the first prompt you choose a second number that you would like to perform the calculation on.



It will then provide the result to the calculation
